      "['Kundapur-Karwar NH66 stretch to be widened\\nNew Year appears to have brought new hopes to the people of coastal Karnataka with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiating steps to widen a 189-km stretch of the national highway between Kundapura and Karwar (up to Goa border).This NH 66 stretch is a part of the 296-km highway from Goa border (near Karwar) to Kerala border (near Talapady) in the State.The stretch between Kundapur and Talapady, via Mangalore, on the same highway is now being widened by the NHAI.With the new project on the anvil, the highway passing through Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts via Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Honnavar, Bhatkal, Kundapur, Udupi, Surathkal, Mangalore, Thokkottu, and Talapady is all set to get a facelift. Sources in the NHAI told\\nThe Hindu that it had called for Request for Qualification (RFQ) from companies interested in taking up the Kundapura-Goa stretch.\\nSo far, 39 companies had responded.The NHAI had proposed to widen the stretch under build-operate-and-transfer (BoT) basis under Phase IV of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,687 crore.A main feature under the project was an elevated highway of 350-m length and 12 m width which would come up at Maravanthe, a tourist spot, where the existing highway passes through a narrow stretch between the sea and the river.The elevated highway would be built across the river while the surface level of the existing highway would be raised by about a metre and strengthened.Sea erosionSources said that only one-way traffic would be allowed on the elevated highway. Maravanthe hit the headlines during monsoons for apprehensions of people over the safety of the highway due to sea erosion.The Government had dumped huge rocks on the sea shore there to prevent erosion and damage to the highway.Quoting the final feasibility report on Kundapura-Goa border project prepared by a private company for the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the sources said that 14 major bridges, 41 minor bridges, six road-over-bridges (RoBs), and three road-under-bridges (RuBs) would be built.Four tunnels and an equal number of flyovers would be built. There would be 53 bus bays and four truck bays.The Government would have to acquire 260 hectares of private land in 66 villages and 122 hectares of forestland for completing the project, the sources said.\\n\\n']\n",
      "[\"People may be spared of power cuts during summer\\nThe Government is confident that there will be no power cuts in the State in summer, except when the generation units break down.Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, Minister for Energy Shobha Karandlaje said the current demand for power was 163 million units against the availability of 175 mu. With sufficient storage in the reservoirs, there would not be problems in the generation of hydel power. About 45 mu. of hydel power was being generated daily, she said.To activate the hydel power generation, she said that the functioning of one unit at the Raichur Thermal Power Station would be suspended for a few days. She said the Government anticipated no constraints in meeting power demand, expected to touch 180 mu. in summer as hydel reservoirs had adequate storage. The Government held a meeting with managements of sugar factories on Friday and they promised the availability of 400 MW. But the managements had been demanding Rs. 5.50 a unit and the Government had decided to pay Rs. 5.06 a unit.Following last year's stampede at Sabarimala, which claimed over 100 lives, the Minister said the Kerala Government requested the State Government to set up health camps at Sabarimala.The Minister said three health camps would be set up — one each at Sannidhi, Pampa and Nilakhal. Fifteen doctors and three ambulances from the State would be deployed at the three camps.One unit in RTPS to be suspended for a few daysHealth camps to be set up for Ayyappa devotees\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"“Government won't accept all amendments”\\nUnion Home Minister P. Chidambaram said on Saturday that the government would not accept all amendments moved by the Opposition to the Lokpal and Lokayukthas Bill.“I can't recall any example where 187 amendments were introduced in the second House [the Rajya Sabha] by the same parties which voted in the first House [the Lok Sabha],” he said, asserting that the government had stalled the BJP's attempts at scuttling the Bill.“We may have to redraft or redefine one or two clauses. We may have to accept one or two amendments. But we can't accept 187 amendments. It will be an unrecognisable Bill.”Mr. Chidambaram said had the Bill been passed in the present form, Parliament would have become the laughing stock of the judiciary when it reviewed it.Responding to the BJP's comments on the exclusion of the Lokayukta, he said the ‘sense of the House' resolution prepared by prominent leaders, including Lal Krishna Advani, had stated that the Bill would have Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in the States.“Inclusion of Lokayuktas is one of the key demands of [social activist] Anna Hazare,” he said, criticising the BJP for opposing it at the last moment. “I sincerely hope that Anna Hazare recognises that the BJP opposed the Lokayukta in one form or the other. He had raised the issue that the common man was affected by corruption at the lower level, which is in the State's jurisdiction. That should become the focus of the Bill — that political parties want Lokpal at the Centre but no Lokayukta at the State level,” Mr. Chidambaram said.He refuted the allegation that the absence of 13 Congress MPs made the government weaker on the floor of the House. “We would have required 338 votes to pass the Constitution (116th Amendment) Bill. Let us not have any illusion. The absence of 13 MPs did not make an issue.”He said the government would work with its allies, especially the Trinamool Congress, to convince them to vote for the Bill in the budget session.Reacting to the lukewarm response to Team Anna's protest in Mumbai, Mr. Chidambaram said: “I think people are beginning to realise that though civil society has the right to raise its voice, law-making is a complex exercise best left to the legislature.”Security improvedMr. Chidambaram said the security situation, especially in troubled areas such as Jammu and Kashmir and north-eastern States and the naxal-affected States, was better than what it was last year.“2011 has been the most peaceful year in Jammu and Kashmir. Tourism has gone 60 per cent higher than in 2010. The number of lives lost is at a historic low. Violence has reduced, but the level of violence is still unacceptably high,” he said.He said the focus for the next two-three years would be capacity-building and incorporation of new technology for better security.Gadchiroli concernsMr. Chidambaram expressed unhappiness at the situation in the naxal-affected Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra.“We had a review meeting…a month ago. I am not happy with the situation there. We have pumped in a lot of resources there. Still, there is a lot of concern about Gadchiroli. Naxalism has declined but it has to decline further.”Had Lokpal Bill been passed in present form, it would have become a laughing stock of judiciaryAbsence of 13 Congress MPs was insignificant as government needed 338 votes to pass the Bill\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"Manmohan's New Year pledge: ‘honest and more efficient' rule\\nAmid an acrimonious blame game between the government and the Opposition over the Lokpal Bill, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said it was “unfortunate” that it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha.He reiterated his government's commitment to enact an effective Lokpal Bill.In his New Year address to the nation, Dr. Singh acknowledged that the concern over corruption had moved to the “centre stage” and pledged to personally work to provide an “honest and more efficient government.”A five-point ‘policy agenda' of his government for 2012 dominated the long message of the Prime Minister — livelihood security (education, food, health and employment); economic security; energy security; ecological security and national security.He listed a series of initiatives taken by his government, including the introduction of Bills for a citizen's charter and judicial accountability. “These initiatives will take time to have full effect and we must, therefore, be patient.”Emphasising that new institutions such as the Lokpal and the Lokayuktas were an important part of the solution, Dr. Singh said there was also a need for reforms in the systems of government which would increase transparency so that the scope of misgovernance is reduced.Dr. Singh argued that with economic reforms unveiled in the early 90s old forms of corruption have vanished but new forms of corruption have emerged which need to be tackled.“Elimination of corruption is critical to support genuine entrepreneurship. It is also the demand of the ordinary citizen who encounters corruption all too often in everyday transactions with those in authority.”In an obvious reference to the staunch opposition by UPA ally, Trinamool Congress, to the opening of multi-brand retail sector to foreign players, Dr. Singh said, “We should not lock ourselves into a blind refusal to contemplate change. If we have confidence in ourselves, we will be able to meet any challenge.”Stressing the need for restoring fiscal stability, the Prime Minister said the route towards the goal in the medium term would be to move to the regime of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Some of the State governments including those ruled by allies of the UPA have reservations over the regime.Dr. Singh also advocated phased reduction in subsidies as another step towards greater economic security. At the same time he acknowledged that some subsidies, such as in food, were justifiable on social grounds and expected to expand once the Food Security Bill (pet Bill of Congress president Sonia Gandhi) becomes operational.On energy security, the Prime Minister maintained that both goals of expanding new investment and achieving energy efficiency required a more rational pricing policy, aligning India's energy prices with global rates in a phased manner.\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"Karunanidhi disagrees with Chandy's views on Mullaperiyar\\nDMK president M. Karunanidhi on Saturday said that when the Mullaperiyar dam issue was before the Supreme Court, any effort by the Kerala Government to reduce the water level and attempt to construct a new dam would be viewed as subversion of the judicial process and denial of justice to the people of Tamil Nadu.In his letter to Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who had responded to his earlier letter, Mr. Karunanidhi disagreed with Mr. Chandy's view that he (Mr. Karunanidhi) had dismissed the need for a new dam at Mullaperiyar and ignored the safety of the people living there.He argued that the Supreme Court had already given a clear verdict that the Mullaperiyar dam was strong.“The seven-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court had, in 2001 itself, come to a definite conclusion that the dam is strong. The Central Government had already taken a stand before the Supreme Court that the dam is strong. The Advocate-General of Kerala himself has stated that the Mullaperiyar dam is strong enough and if the dam is affected, as you have said, the water of the dam can be stored in Idukki, Seruthoni and Kulamavu dams,” Mr. Karunanidhi said.‘Stop misinformation campaign'Noting that the Kerala High Court had conveyed its satisfaction over this view of the AG, Mr. Karunanidhi wanted to know whether it was constitutional to resolve to construct a new dam and to reduce the water-level to 120 feet. “Is not the duty cast on every one of us to honour and protect our federal structure?” he asked.Mr. Karunanidhi also drew Mr. Chandy's attention to the violence unleashed by the anti-social elements in Kerala against Tamils and vehicles going from Tamil Nadu in the wake of a “sustained misinformation campaign about the safety of the dam by the Government of Kerala.” “That is why tension prevails in the border districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala,” he further said.Stressing the need for bringing peace and tranquillity, he said Mr. Chandy, an experienced politician representing an old and responsible national political party, would realize the urgency and importance of normality to be restored and ensured.He said all concerned should wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court, as it was seized of the matter and no one should be allowed to precipitate it by instigating the public and casting aspersions.“I therefore request you to use your good offices to convince people of Kerala that there is no need to fear about the safety of the dam. The Indian Constitution and the Supreme Court will objectively take care of the interests of all citizens,” he added.\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"Lokpal Bill will remain alive till end of current Lok Sabha term\\nWith the government asserting its intention to take up the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, 2011 for passage during the budget session of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha would have the opportunity to vote on the proposed legislation.As per procedure, the government can bring forward the Bill before the House by mentioning it in the List of Business, Parliament officials said here.The earliest opportunity for the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) to take up the Bill would of course be the next budget session that usually commences towards the end of February. In the event of the Bill not coming up during the next or subsequent sessions, it would remain alive till the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha.Article 107 (5) of the Constitution reads: “A Bill which is pending in the House of the People, or which has been passed by the House of the People is pending in the Council of States, shall, subject to the provisions of article, lapse on dissolution of the House of the People.''Otherwise, once the Rajya Sabha takes a view and passes the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill with amendment(s) — official or moved by a Member —, the Bill will have to go back the Lok Sabha for consideration and passage of the amended Bill. The House has the option of re-considering and passing the Bill so amended or rejecting it.The government then has the option to work on the passage of the Bill through a joint session of Parliament. Article 108 states that such a session can be called if after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House (a) the Bill is rejected by the other House; or (c) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being passed by it.The last time Parliament passed a Bill at a joint session was the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act in 2002 by the Atal Behari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government. The Congress-led UPA repealed it after coming to power in 2004.\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"Fishermen recall ‘Thane' horror\\nThe tsunami memorial in the Veerampattinam fishing village lies half buried in sand, a testament to the destruction wrought by Cyclone Thane on the small hamlet on Friday.As soon as one enters the village, one gets a sense of the loss faced by the people, with all houses being empty and occupants sitting outside with their belongings trying to assess the damage and salvage what they can.“The tsunami was nothing compared to the cyclone. The howling winds will haunt me for the rest of my life,” said Anbarasan, a village elder.“At no time do I remember seeing anything similar,” he says. “In 1972, there was a cyclone and a couple of huts were washed away. A few years ago, there was another, but the havoc created by Thane is unparalleled. If not for our local deity, the entire population of our village would have perished,” he said.The villagers shudder as they describe the night before the cyclone. Early, on Thursday night it was business as usual for most of the families who live in this hamlet. Since they had been warned not to go out into sea, the entire village was up till midnight when the winds picked up. Around 2 a.m., they realized that the wind speed was increasing, and so the village took shelter in the local temple.Those who were unable to walk were carried to the temple and by about 3 a.m. when the cyclone unleashed its fury, all the people from the village were inside the temple, huddling together to protect themselves from the winds. For the next five hours, nobody moved as they sat there silently praying for their lives as their houses and belongings were destroyed in the wind and rain.Throughout Friday nobody in the village had anything to eat, since the access road was damaged and virtually nothing remained in the houses, according to Parasu, a fisherman.Stuck in the templeA few houses that were behind a small coconut grove were partially saved and their structures remain intact, but otherwise even cement houses did not survive. The interiors of the houses were filled with mud carried by the wind and virtually everything was still wet.With no electricity and nowhere else to go, the villagers were all forced to stay in the temple. They would continue to stay there for a week at least, they said.\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"More civilians die in Syrian crackdown\\nSyria's Opposition, hoping to topple President Bashar al-Assad, has charted a transitional period, as more civilians died in a regime crackdown despite the presence of peace monitors.Meanwhile the rebel Free Syrian Army said it is suspending operations against the regime forces during the one-month renewable mission of monitors deployed in Syria to implement an Arab League peace plan.At least 32 civilians were killed on Saturday, including 25 who were shot dead by Syrian forces who opened fire on massive protests that rocked the country while the monitors toured flashpoints, a watchdog said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported that Syrian forces used “nail bombs” to disperse anti-regime rallies, and fired live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades at tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters.Funerals for several victims were held on Saturday across Syria, the watchdog said, including in the northern city of Idlib, where mourners called for revenge, a YouTube footage showed.The security forces also fired warning shots into the air as thousands of people began pouring into a square in the restive Damascus suburb of Douma for a funeral ceremony, the Britain-based Observatory said.In Cairo, headquarters of the Arab League, the Opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) and the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria (NCB) inked a deal late Friday as they eye a post-regime transition.An English language statement from the NCB said the deal “sets out the political and democratic rules for the transitional period,” should Assad be ousted by the uprising that erupted in March.The accord also “determines the important parameters for Syria's future which aspire to ensure that the homeland and every citizen's rights are treated with dignity, and for the foundation of a civil democratic state.”NCB chief Hassan Abdel Azim told AFP the accord is designed to fend off a Libya-style foreign military intervention in Syria and protect civilians suffering from the wrath of Assad's autocratic regime.The U.N. estimates that more than 5,000 people have been killed in the regime's crackdown on dissent since March.The Assad government insists the violence has been instigated by “terrorist armed gangs” with foreign help.On Friday, responding to calls by the Internet activists, tens of thousands of Syrians flooded the streets across the country to make their voices heard by the Arab observers.“We urge you to make a clear distinction between the assassin and the victim,” activists of the Syrian Revolution 2011 said on their Facebook page.The U.N. said it expects Syria to grant unfettered access to the hard-won Arab observer mission which Damascus only agreed to after weeks of prevarication.“It is critical that the observer mission be given unhindered access and full cooperation by the government of Syria, and that its independence and impartiality be fully preserved,” U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said.According to the Observatory, monitors visited Idlib, Hama, Daraa and the Homs neighbourhood of Baba Amro on Friday. State media said they also went to Hama and spoke to wounded people in a government hospital. — AFP\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "['CAT rejects petition against selection of DD and AIR chief\\nThe Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Delhi has dismissed an application challenging the March 21, 2011 revised recommendation of the selection committee for the posts of Director General of All India Radio/Doordarshan.The Bench comprising Chairman Justice V.K. Bali and Member Ramesh Chandra Panda dismissed the application filed by G. Jayalal, who was affected by the revised recommendation. He had also challenged the March 30 order by which L.D. Mandloi was given charge as DD of AIR in addition to his post of DG, Doordarshan.The Bench in its recent order, however, directed the Centre and Prasar Bharati to convene a meeting of the Board as early as possible to determine the order of merit of the respective candidates. It said the exercise must be completed as expeditiously as possible but definitely within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.Justice Bali, who wrote the order, said: “If the outcome of the meeting be only for endorsement of the view that came about in showing the order of preference of candidates through circulation, nothing more would be required to be done, as surely, the candidature of those who have been shown in order of preference for both the posts under contention, has since already been approved by the ACC. However, if in the deliberations that may take place in the meeting of the Board, as ordained, a different result may ensue, the Board shall make recommendation accordingly for approval of the ACC, and in that event, if the appointment of any of the selected candidate is to be set aside, the order in that regard shall be passed.”The Bench said: “Insofar as Mr. Mandloi, 4th respondent, is concerned, if his selection is not approved for the post of Director General (AIR), then the same shall be recommended for approval for the post of Director General (Doordarshan). The final selection would abide by the recommendations that may be made in the meeting that has now to be held by the Board, and the approval of ACC in that regard.”Mr. Jayalal, in his application claimed that he was recommended by the selection committee constituted by the Prasar Bharati Board for his appointment as Director General, All India Radio, but the recommendation of the selection committee had been overturned on the dictates of the government. He alleged that the selection committee, changed its recommendation, preferring Mr. Mandloi, the 4{+t}{+h}respondent, whereas the original recommendation of the committee was that while the applicant would be the first choice, the 4th respondent would be second. He alleged that undue pressure from the concerned Ministry had resulted in revision of the recommendation with mala fide intentions, and without any valid reason the Board members were directed to append their signatures to suit certain candidates.Rejecting the application, the Bench said: “Prima facie, or, on first blush, the contention raised by the applicant may appear to be impressive. There may be a presumption that the names arranged in the minutes of the meeting may be in order of preference, but the same, at the most, would be a rebuttable presumption. It cannot be said to be irresistible. It appears to us that if the names would have been in order of preference, it does not appear plausible that the name of Mr. Mandloi would have been mentioned under both posts. It may be so, but it does not appear probable. The things have been clarified by the OSD, when we required him to file an additional affidavit.”\\n\\n']\n",

His father, Kalesh, 35, who tried to save the boy is reported missing. At Manamboor in Chirayanakeezhu taluk, three-year-old Ammu and her grandmother Lalithambika, 70, were electrocuted in the compound of their house.The capital city soaked in 18 cm of rain till 8.30 a.m. on Saturday and 22 cm of rain till 5.30 p.m. As storm water canals that crisscross the city and the Killi and Karamana rivers were in spate, low-lying areas were inundated early on Saturday morning. Five hundred families were shifted to nine relief camps. While 48 houses were partially damaged, three were destroyed in the rain. In Kollam, there was power supply disruption in many parts. The district experienced heavy rainfall beginning Friday afternoon. The heavy rain continued till Saturday afternoon.Pilgrims' plightIncessant rain in the forests of Pathanamthitta district caused much hardship to Sabarimala pilgrims on Saturday. The Pampa river swelled with heavy inflow from the catchment areas upstream.The police issued warnings to pilgrims and shopkeepers at the Pampa Manalpuram on Friday evening about possible flash floods in the event of landslips in the forests. No vehicle was permitted at the parking lots on the river banks at the Pampa-Triveni on Friday and Saturday.Pilgrims trekked the hills of Neelimala and Appachimedu braving the downpour. The police periodically blocked the pilgrims at Pampa, Sabaripeedhom, Marakkoottom, and Saramkuthy. The pilgrims had little option but to wait in the rain with the drenched bundle ‘Irumudikkettu' inside the packed iron barricades for hours together. Many pilgrims were stranded at the Sannidhanam owing to shortage of sufficient shelters. Most shelters at Sabarimala were occupied by Friday afternoon itself.Traffic snarls in KochiIn Kochi, unexpected rain held up traffic and temporarily hit the annual, year-end, Cochin Carnival on Fort Kochi beach on Saturday.A spokesman for the Cochin Carnival said that swimming, a favourite among competitions, was cancelled because of heavy winds and rain.

      "[\"Telecom sector still at the crossroads\\nSoon after taking charge from his predecessor A. Raja (now in jail in the 2G spectrum scam case), Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal on January 1 last year came out with his ‘100-day' agenda, promising major policy initiatives for the troubled telecom sector. But even after one year, the telecom sector it still standing at the crossroads.Pointing towards lacunae in the national telecom policy for the massive spectrum scam in 2008, Mr. Sibal had promised a ‘clear and transparent regime' to address all issues plaguing the sector. Though the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has come out with the draft telecom policy, its main contours that would shape the industry's future are still not clear.The most controversial issue being one-time charge for the spectrum that old operators have been possessing. The National Telecom Policy is likely to be announced in mid-2012.How the things will shape up for the telecom sector in 2012 has been spelt out in the draft policy which says that there will be new licensing norms, exit policy for operators, while sharing and trading of spectrum, and mergers and acquisitions will be allowed.Similarly, spectrum will help government generate more revenue in a transparent manner. But how will the DoT address the growing need for more spectrum is still unclear even as its efforts to get radio waves vacated from defence forces have failed so far.Mr. Sibal had pinned major hopes on the launch of 3G services to improve sentiments in the market, which has failed to take off in a big way. But the biggest twist has been the differences between operators and the DoT over intra-circle roaming, the issue which is now in court.The government also continues to struggle while dealing with security-related issues. Though the BlackBerry issue has taken the backseat for now, monitoring of social networking websites and Internet content has put the government in the dock. Similarly, no major progress has been made on the issue of electromagnetic radiation from growing number of towers and skyrocketing sales of mobile handsets. Notably, all these were major priorities of the DoT in 2011.However, on two fronts — introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) and check on unsolicited telemarketing calls — the DoT has delivered.While the new policy talks about expansion of MNP from circle to pan-India level, it also promises to end national roaming that would make calls cheaper. But Mr. Sibal will have to focus on pesky SMS being generated from the Internet.In 2012, apart from coming out with a strong and effective new telecom policy with futuristic goals, Mr. Sibal will have to take measures to instil confidence in the telecom sector, besides bringing in more foreign investments. Proliferation of broadband is a major task in hand, streamlining the functioning of loss-making Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., which includes bringing in the voluntary retirement scheme for its three-lakh employees and a public issue to improve the financial health of the telecom PSU, will be a big challenge for the Minister.Manufacturing is another area where the DoT needs to focus this year. Mr. Sibal has already announce policy initiatives to give boost to domestic manufacturing and preferential treatment to smaller firms, but to check growing influence of foreign players in the growing telecom sector, particularly that of Chinese multi-national firms in view of risks related to national security, will be a major challenge.Kapil Sibal will have to take measures to instil confidence in the telecom sector, besides bringing in more foreign investments\\n\\n\"]\n",

Resultant new order inflow for companies in the sector has been muted over the past two quarters.The rating agency said despite having healthy unexecuted order books, almost all construction companies are plagued by a number of slow-moving orders due to issues related to land acquisition; securing requisite clearances; labour shortage and other sector-specific issues such as payment issues plaguing irrigation projects in Andhra Pradesh and issues faced by power projects.The slowdown in the pace of execution can be gauged by the quantum of stalled projects, which has been steadily increasing since September 2010. As of September 2011, the quantum of stalled projects increased by 42 per cent on a year-on-year basis (15 per cent on quarter-on-quarter basis). Consequently, the year-on-year revenue growth of construction companies in the first and second quarters of 2011-12 has been the slowest as compared to the past few years. Labour shortages and government welfare schemes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme have resulted in higher labour costs.

      "[\"India's bowlers should stir the batsmen\\nVirender Sehwag was asked during the first Test in Melbourne if Gautam Gambhir's lack of runs was worrying. Fixing the questioner in an unblinking gaze, Sehwag said: “One innings, man. Long tour.”This, of course, was before India's second innings. It was another of those moments between reporter and cricketer, a question inadequately articulated and thus intriguingly answered. The question was about long-term form, Sehwag's answer, about the challenges of playing Test cricket in Australia and the patience needed when assessing it.Four Indians — Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Umesh Yadav, and R. Ashwin — played their first Test in Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Their performances, as opener, middle-order bat, fast-bowler, and spinner, were indicative of India's; they raised issues, which, if contemplated, might clear the gloom of defeat.Gambhir's is the most interesting case, for there is not the slightest doubt that he is a first-rate batsman who seems to have an extra dimension in a crisis. But the runs have come less prolifically over the last two years: he made 994 runs from 33 innings at 32.06 in 2010 and 2011 as compared to 1861 runs from 25 innings at 77.54 in 2008 and 2009.Even during this dip in form, the significant innings under pressure hasn't been beyond him. His 97 in the World Cup final in 2011 was made in a different format, but the magnitude of the occasion warrants a mention.In South Africa, against Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel on largely bowler-friendly pitches, he recovered after falling for 5 in his first innings in the country to score 80, 93, and 64.Vital tourThe tour of Australia is a vital time for Gambhir. His time in England was blighted by injury, a bruised elbow followed by a concussion. This severely compromised his ability — he suffered dizziness and nausea, which made tracking the ball difficult.For a man who is admittedly insecure (but, paradoxically, convinced about his abilities), the series against Australia was a chance to prove himself in trying circumstances.Gambhir seemed to feel this burden at the MCG, his anxiety conveyed in his bottom-hand grip. When he's at his best, the hands work in unison, top leading, bottom modulating.In both innings of the first Test, his left hand was taking undue control of most strokes. His footwork, which had so noticeably improved during his return to Test cricket in 2008, was less certain as well.There were better signs in the second innings, but the manner of dismissal, identical to the first innings, suggested that he hasn't yet a measure of the bounce in Australia.So far in his career, Gambhir has found a way even when others have written him off. It's this mental strength and fixity of purpose he'll need in the remaining Tests in Australia.Out of depthKohli seemed out of his depth in Melbourne. He pushed at the ball, hands thrusting, over-anxious, in the first innings.In the second, he couldn't bring his bat around in time because his front foot had got in the way of an in-nipper. India hasn't found a man for No. 6 since Sourav Ganguly vacated the position. Neither Yuvraj Singh nor Suresh Raina could make it his own. Like these two, Kohli has exceptional ball-striking talent.It will be fascinating to see if he can adapt to the five-day format. He had trouble with the short ball in the West Indies; the bouncing, moving ball bothered him here. Kohli is an ambitious and determined young man. But he will have to find a solution soon, for Rohit Sharma, who's waiting in the wings, does seem more assured against bounce.Umesh's performance was by far the most heartening. From a simple, strong, repeatable action, he bowled at rapid speeds and often swung the ball. He defeated batsmen in defence and came back with the same pace late in the day, both signs of a quality fast-bowler.He also seemed to know what he was doing. But for the misguided adventure with the short ball on the first afternoon, he tested the batsman with line and length.With Umesh and Ishant Sharma breaking the 150 kmph mark and Zaheer Khan looking like he has regained his best, India's seam attack appears capable of taking 20 Australian wickets.Besides there's Ashwin. The young off-spinner did enough to suggest he belongs. His three overs on the fourth day was the only time he seemed unsure of himself.He had trouble with his consistency, but his variations in pace and trajectory and the work he put on the ball kept the batsmen honest.Sehwag, in the afore-mentioned press conference, called the bowling attack the best he has played with; if only it could stir its batsmen into the greatness they are capable of.\\n\\n\"]\n",

A central midfield comprising Rafael Da Silva and Park Ji-Sung failed to ask serious questions of the Blackburn defence, while United badly missed the attacking thrust of the rested Wayne Rooney.And on 51 minutes United was left reeling when Yakubu bulldozed through some feeble United defending to drive in his second for 2-0.United responded almost immediately, however, sweeping forward from the re-start and pulling a goal back through Berbatov when the Bulgarian headed in Rafael's angled shot.On 62 minutes Berbatov levelled a pulsating encounter, sweeping in from close range after a fine run and cross from Antonio Valencia. It seemed as if United was poised to go and claim the victory but de Gea's blunder gifted a precious victory to Steve Kean's Rovers.Stiliyan Petrov and Darren Bent struck the late goals that secured a 3-1 victory for Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge and ensured Chelsea was unable to force its way back into the title race.It was unable to make the most of United's defeat despite Didier Drogba putting the home side ahead with a first half penalty, his 150th goal for the club. Stephen Ireland, criticised midweek after a photograph appeared on Twitter of him apparently smoking a shisha pipe and drinking a glass of wine, equalised in the 27th minute.And Alex McLeish's side then wrapped up the win with two goals in the final seven minutes to make it four games without a win for Chelsea and confirm the rebuilding task that lies ahead for Villas-Boas in 2012.The results:On Saturday: Arsenal 1 (van Persie 60) bt QPR 0; Bolton 1 (Ricketts 22) drew with Wolves 1 (Fletcher 49); Chelsea 1 (Drogba 23-pen) lost to Aston Villa 3 (Ireland 28, Petrov 83, Bent 86); Norwich 1 (Jackson 90) drew with Fulham 1 (Sa 7); Stoke 2 (Walters 77-pen, Jerome 84) drew with Wigan 2 (Moses 45, Watson 87-pen); Swansea 1 (Sinclair 84) drew with Tottenham 1 (Van der Vaart 44); Manchester United 2 (Berbatov 52, 62) lost to Blackburn 3 (Yakubu 16-pen, 51, Hanley 80).\\nOn Friday: Liverpool 3 (Bellamy 29, 67, Gerrard 78) bt Newcastle 1 (Agger 25-og). — AFP\\n\\n\\n\"]\n",

      "[\"Rare success of 3 Idiots breaks China's Bollywood Great Wall\\nIndian visitors to Beijing are, more often than not, greeted by taxi drivers with passionate renditions of ‘Awara Hoon,' a song that has, for decades, defined India in the Chinese imagination.But today, Indian visitors will increasingly find younger Chinese welcoming them with: ‘All izz well?' Few films have made as deep an impact in this country since the days of Raj Kapoor as Rajkumar Hirani's 2009 film,\\n3Idiots . The film struck an instant chord with China's famously overworked students, so much so that some Chinese universities were, last year, even prescribing the film in their coursework as a kind of stress-relief in their classrooms.\\n“Rote learning made me rigid, stupid and I ended up like a machine,” one blogger, named Nei Yi Guo Jiang, wrote last year in praise of the film. “I felt like a real idiot compared to the three in this wonderful movie.”Last month, the popular film finally made it to big screens in China — one of the few Indian films that have been screened publicly here since the 1970s, following subsequent censorship restrictions.‘New-year release'3 Idiots was also the first Indian film to be accorded the sought-after status of a ‘New Year release.'\\nIn the first two weeks of its release, the film has raked in Rs. 11 crore at the Chinese box office, according to recent media reports — a rare success that has given Indian movie houses renewed hope of penetrating the lucrative but challenging Chinese market.The film was also released in Hong Kong in September, and raked in 17 million RMB (Rs. 14.4 crore) in its first three months.Movie posters in Beijing promoting the film described it as the “longest new year celebration film and a film that can make you laugh for three hours.”Chinese analysts say its box office performance is no mean feat considering that its release comes almost two years after the film first became a hit in China, already being viewed widely on popular video-sharing websites and accessed through the thriving pirated DVD market.High Internet ratingOn Douban, a widely-used web portal similar to YouTube, the film received 224,668 views as of Sunday, with an average rating of 9.1 out of 10 — among the highest for any film on the website.The film was imported by the state-run China Film Group, which is one of the Chinese film industry's biggest players.Besides the film's already cult status among Chinese students, its early success has also been driven by the China Film Group bagging a big-name Chinese star, Tang Wei, to provide the voice for the female lead character. Ms. Tang rose to prominence following her much-praised, and controversial, role in Ang Lee's award-winning\\nLust, Caution . This marks her first involvement in a foreign film, Chinese media reported, highlighting the A-list, red-carpet welcome accorded to the Aamir Khan film.\\n The success of\\n3 Idiots , as well as the widely popular\\nSlumdog Millionaire , has created a new push for Indian cinema in China, film industry experts say.\\nFilm import curbsIndian films were widely popular in China up until the 1970s when Raj Kapoor was a household name in this country. Few Indian films have since been released widely in Chinese theatres.According to China's import restrictions, only 22 foreign films can be screened every year.Hollywood importsThe quota is usually filled by Hollywood imports. While Bollywood remains popular, it is not seen as having among Chinese youth the mass appeal of Western films, industry analysts have argued. Shah Rukh Khan's\\nMy Name is Khan was released here in 2010, but performed below industry expectations, in part because it was not seen as fitting the mould of light-hearted and colourful Indian films that are popular in China.\\n Indian officials have long pressed the Chinese government to loosen restrictions on Bollywood imports. If\\n3 Idiots does well enough, they now hope, Chinese distributors will begin to rethink their reluctance to import Indian films.\\n There are signs that this is already beginning to happen following the popularity of\\nSlumdog Millionaire and\\n3 Idiots .\\nJoint projects The China Film Group last year lent its backing to a first-of-its-kind joint film project backed by Indian and Chinese investors, for the first-ever made in China Bollywood film. The $10 million\\nGold Struck will not be considered an import since it is being co-produced by the China Film Group.\\nJoint productions, experts say, can become the formula to bring Bollywood to China. Cindy Shyu, CEO of Light House Productions, which is behind\\nGold Struck , said the success of\\n3 Idiots played a big part in giving her enough confidence that Indian films had a big enough market here.\\n “Chinese audiences are interested in Indian films and dance, but have little opportunity to experience Indian cinema,” she told\\nThe Hindu in an interview last year. “This film, I hope, will fill that gap.”\\n An instant hit with Chinese youth,\\n3 Idiots raked in Rs. 11 crore at the box-office in first 2 weeks\\nIndian films, especially Raj Kapoor starrers, were largely popular in China till 1970s\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "[\"No fast, no andolan for a month, doctor tells Anna\\nAfter abruptly ending a three-day fast in Mumbai within two days owing to failing health, anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare might not even be able to undertake a tour of the five election-bound States within the next one month, as his doctor has advised him against it. K.H. Sancheti, who is attending on Mr. Hazare, said that given his age, Mr. Hazare should take at least a month's rest. “He is strictly being advised not to undertake any kind of travel for the next one month. No andolans and no physical or mental stress,” Dr. Sancheti told\\nThe Hindu on Sunday evening.\\n“He should allow himself to recoup; he should recognise the ageing process and accept it, giving due respect to nature.”On Saturday, Dr. Sancheti said Mr. Hazare was advised not to go on fast anymore as his “age and resistance levels do not permit it.”Mr. Hazare was scheduled to tour the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa after the course of action was decided at Team Anna's Core Committee meeting planned for January 2 and 3 at Ralegan Siddhi. The meeting has also been cancelled.His health and inability to undertake what he has called the “fight against the Congress” will be a cause of concern for Team Anna.Mr. Hazare was admitted to Sancheti Hospital here late on Saturday evening. After being under observation all day, he showed “improvement,” Dr. Sancheti said.Ruling out pneumonia, which was a cause for concern, he said Mr. Hazare suffered from bronchitis.Speaking to reporters for the first time after returning from Mumbai, Mr. Hazare said he was getting better. “I am not so unwell as is being made out. I am much better now,” he said from his hospital bed on Sunday evening.\\n\\n\"]\n",
      "['Metro snag leaves many stranded\\nHundreds of passengers were stranded at Delhi Metro stations after the overhead electrification system on the Dwarka-Noida City stretch developed a major snag, forcing the trains to take longer halts on Sunday.Most affected was the Blue Line from Dwarka Sector 21 to the Noida City Centre, which also has a branch from the Yamuna Bank to Vaishali in Ghaziabad. According to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the snag developed in the overhead electrification along the route, causing trains to stop for some time between the Barakhamba and Pragati Maidan stations.However, angry passengers, stranded in trains and at metro stations, had altogether a different story to tell. A passenger said trouble apparently began around 7 p.m. “I was at the Mayur Vihar Phase-I station when a train stopped. There was a loud noise, probably due to a spark in the overhead wires, after which all the passengers jumped out of the train. They got back into the train after a while,” he said.Another passenger, who boarded at Janakpuri for Rajiv Chowk around 10-15 p.m., said the train stopped for over 10 minutes at every station and in about an hour, he could only reach Shadipur. “At one station, it stopped for almost 20 minutes. It usually takes me about 40 minutes to reach Rajiv Chowk from Janakpuri. Those who took the train at Dwarka also said that it had been happening from the first station,” he said, sharing the harrowing experience.Large crowds were seen at the Rajiv Chowk station till late at night as the trains were delayed and many had to wait for over an hour for a train. “I reached the station around 9-15 p.m., but I am stranded here for the past 90 minutes. Many passengers have even decided to book a cab home,” said Augustine, adding that several passengers were planning to get a refund.For their part, the metro authorities claimed that the snag had been fixed and services resumed.\\n\\n']\n"

      "('2012/01/01/', 'Kundapur-Karwar NH66 stretch to be widened', 'New Year appears to have brought new hopes to the people of coastal Karnataka with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiating steps to widen a 189-km stretch of the national highway between Kundapura and Karwar (up to Goa border).This NH 66 stretch is a part of the 296-km highway from Goa border (near Karwar) to Kerala border (near Talapady) in the State.The stretch between Kundapur and Talapady, via Mangalore, on the same highway is now being widened by the NHAI.With the new project on the anvil, the highway passing through Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts via Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Honnavar, Bhatkal, Kundapur, Udupi, Surathkal, Mangalore, Thokkottu, and Talapady is all set to get a facelift. Sources in the NHAI told\\nThe Hindu that it had called for Request for Qualification (RFQ) from companies interested in taking up the Kundapura-Goa stretch.\\nSo far, 39 companies had responded.The NHAI had proposed to widen the stretch under build-operate-and-transfer (BoT) basis under Phase IV of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,687 crore.A main feature under the project was an elevated highway of 350-m length and 12 m width which would come up at Maravanthe, a tourist spot, where the existing highway passes through a narrow stretch between the sea and the river.The elevated highway would be built across the river while the surface level of the existing highway would be raised by about a metre and strengthened.Sea erosionSources said that only one-way traffic would be allowed on the elevated highway. Maravanthe hit the headlines during monsoons for apprehensions of people over the safety of the highway due to sea erosion.The Government had dumped huge rocks on the sea shore there to prevent erosion and damage to the highway.Quoting the final feasibility report on Kundapura-Goa border project prepared by a private company for the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the sources said that 14 major bridges, 41 minor bridges, six road-over-bridges (RoBs), and three road-under-bridges (RuBs) would be built.Four tunnels and an equal number of flyovers would be built. There would be 53 bus bays and four truck bays.The Government would have to acquire 260 hectares of private land in 66 villages and 122 hectares of forestland for completing the project, the sources said.\\n\\n')\n",
